<h1>CONSTRUCTED & UNATTRIBUTED SYSTEMS</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Attempts to build what history could not provide</div>

<p>
After sufficient exposure to historical systems, an uncomfortable realization
emerges: every cipher inherits the psychology of its creator. Reuse, shortcuts,
and assumptions appear regardless of era.
</p>

<p>
These pages document my attempts to design systems that avoid the failures I
have cataloged elsewhere. They are included for completeness, not endorsement.
</p>

<div class="note">
Initial justification (2019): To understand failure completely, one must attempt
success.
</div>

<h2>System I: Non-Repeating Symbolic Substitution</h2>

<p>
This system replaces plaintext units with symbols drawn from a deliberately
overcomplete set. Unlike standard substitution, mappings are stateful: the same
plaintext unit does not always map to the same symbol.
</p>

<p>
The intention was to suppress frequency analysis entirely by eliminating stable
correspondence. Symbol selection depends on position and prior output.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">⟁⟊⟑ ⟟⟁⟊ ⟒⟊⟑⟒ ⟁⟟</div>

<div class="note">
Outcome: Frequency suppressed. Structural patterns emerged instead.
</div>

<h2>System II: Layered Transposition with Deferred Keys</h2>

<p>
This design combines multiple transposition passes with keys revealed only after
partial decoding. The reader must commit to an interpretation before receiving
information that may invalidate it.
</p>

<p>
I believed this would discourage brute force by forcing human investment.
</p>

<div class="note">
Failure mode: I became the bottleneck. I avoided decoding my own work.
</div>

<h2>System III: Semantic Drift Cipher</h2>

<p>
Rather than encode characters or words, this system encodes semantic distance.
Plaintext is paraphrased repeatedly according to constrained rules until the
original meaning is obscured.
</p>

<p>
Decoding requires reversing interpretive choices rather than substitutions.
</p>

<div class="note">
Critical flaw: Decoding accuracy depends on sharing my assumptions.
</div>

<h2>Artificial Scripts</h2>

<p>
Several scripts were developed in parallel with these systems. Their symbol
sets were intentionally alien but internally consistent. Stroke order and
visual similarity were tuned to invite false pattern recognition.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">⟒⟊⟁⟟ ⟑⟒⟊ ⟁⟟⟊⟒</div>

<p>
I have encountered readers who claimed partial understanding of these scripts.
Their interpretations differed wildly and confidently.
</p>

<div class="note">
Unsettling observation: The scripts succeeded as projection surfaces.
</div>

<h2>Self-Cryptanalysis</h2>

<p>
I subjected each constructed system to the same scrutiny applied elsewhere in
this archive. Where no formal break emerged, I examined my own behavior.
</p>

<p>
Patterns appeared. Avoidance. Rationalization. Emotional attachment to elegance.
These were not properties of the cipher.
</p>

<div class="note">
Personal admission: I trusted my own constructions longer than warranted.
</div>

<h2>Abandonment</h2>

<p>
None of these systems are in active use. Not because they were broken, but
because they demanded qualities from their users that I do not believe persist
outside controlled environments.
</p>

<p>
The desire to invent an unbreakable system now strikes me as naïve. History does
not lack cleverness. It lacks restraint.
</p>

<div class="note">
Final assessment: Constructed systems reveal more about their creator than their
security.
