<h1>ANCIENT & NON-LATIN SYSTEMS</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Where language, ritual, and concealment become indistinguishable</div>

<p>
Unlike modern cryptography, ancient systems rarely separate encryption from
meaning. Many were not designed to protect information from enemies, but to
veil it from the uninitiated. The act of reading itself was often conditional —
dependent on cultural, religious, or philosophical literacy.
</p>

<p>
In these systems, secrecy is not enforced by complexity alone, but by worldview.
To understand the cipher is to understand the cosmology that produced it.
</p>

<h2>Atbash (Hebrew Reversal)</h2>

<p>
Atbash is frequently introduced as a simple monoalphabetic substitution: the
first letter maps to the last, the second to the second-to-last, and so on.
Aleph becomes Tav. Bet becomes Shin. On paper, this is trivial.
</p>

<p>
In practice, Atbash is inseparable from Hebrew philosophical thought. The Hebrew
alphabet is not merely phonetic; it is numeric, symbolic, and cosmological. To
reverse it is not simply to obscure meaning, but to invert creation itself.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">שָׁלוֹם → פָּאֵם</div>

<p>
Several rabbinical texts use Atbash not to hide forbidden ideas, but to gesture
at them. The reader is meant to recognize the inversion and consider why it was
necessary. This is not secrecy — it is discretion.
</p>

<div class="note">
Observation (2012): Atbash assumes reverence for the alphabet. Without that,
it collapses into a toy cipher.
</div>

<h2>Greek Isopsephy</h2>

<p>
Isopsephy assigns numeric values to Greek letters, allowing words and phrases to
be evaluated as sums. This practice predates cryptography as we define it, yet
it frequently functions as one.
</p>

<p>
Two phrases with equal numeric value are said to be equivalent in some deeper
sense. This allows ideas to be encoded without substitution, transposition, or
keys — only arithmetic.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">ΛΟΓΟΣ = 373</div>

<p>
What fascinates me is that isopsephy resists brute force. Without cultural
context, numeric equivalence reveals nothing. With context, it reveals too much.
</p>

<div class="note">
Later note (2017): Modern hash collisions feel philosophically similar, though
stripped of intent.
</div>

<h2>Runic Substitution</h2>

<p>
Runes appear across Europe in contexts that defy classification. Sometimes they
are phonetic. Sometimes symbolic. Occasionally, they are simply Latin letters
written differently.
</p>

<p>
In several manuscripts, Latin prayers are rendered entirely in runes. This does
not encrypt the text — it recontextualizes it. Literacy becomes a gate.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱ</div>

<p>
Runic substitution is best understood as a social cipher. It signals belonging.
Those who can read it do not merely decode — they participate.
</p>

<h2>Acrophonic Systems</h2>

<p>
Acrophonic systems assign meaning based on the initial sound or symbol of a
concept rather than a fixed alphabet. Early Greek numerals, Egyptian tallies,
and several Near Eastern scripts rely on this principle.
</p>

<p>
These systems resist translation because they encode thought rather than sound.
To read them mechanically is to misunderstand them.
</p>

<div class="note">
Failure record: All attempts to algorithmically decode acrophonic inscriptions
have produced convincing but false readings.
</div>

<h2>Cipher vs. Sacred Text</h2>

<p>
The modern distinction between encrypted text and sacred text is artificial.
Many ancient works operate as both simultaneously. Meaning is revealed through
initiation, repetition, and study — not keys.
</p>

<p>
I increasingly suspect that some texts labeled "religious" are better
understood as cryptographic systems whose threat model was ignorance, not
adversaries.
</p>

<div class="note">
Unresolved question: If meaning requires belief, is disbelief a form of
cryptanalysis?
