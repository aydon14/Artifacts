<h1>CLASSICAL EUROPEAN CIPHERS</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Mechanized secrecy, repetition, and the limits of cleverness</div>

<p>
Classical European ciphers are often presented as stepping stones toward modern
cryptography — primitive, flawed, and ultimately obsolete. This framing is
technically correct and intellectually misleading.
</p>

<p>
What distinguishes these systems is not their weakness, but their confidence.
They assume an adversary with limited time, limited tools, and limited patience.
In many historical contexts, this assumption held.
</p>

<div class="note">
Early assumption (2009): Mastering these systems would provide a foundation for
all others. This has proven incomplete.
</div>

<h2>Caesar and Shift Variants</h2>

<p>
The Caesar cipher is frequently reduced to a single shift of three. In practice,
shift ciphers appear with arbitrary rotations, mixed alphabets, and occasionally
null characters designed to mislead casual analysis.
</p>

<p>
My standard method is mechanical: enumerate all shifts, score results against
expected language frequency, then read the highest-ranking candidates manually.
This works almost every time.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">KHOOR ZRUOG</div>

<div class="note">
Later frustration (2016): The ease of breaking shift ciphers has made them
uninteresting. Their persistence is cultural, not cryptographic.
</div>

<h2>Affine Ciphers</h2>

<p>
Affine ciphers introduce arithmetic into substitution, mapping letters via
linear functions. They feel more sophisticated, but their structure remains
rigid. Once the key space is enumerated, resistance collapses.
</p>

<p>
Breaking affine ciphers requires little intuition. Two known plaintext-letter
pairs are sufficient. The rest is algebra.
</p>

<div class="note">
Observation: Systems that yield to formula rarely survive human curiosity.
</div>

<h2>Transposition Systems</h2>

<p>
Rail fences, columnar transpositions, and their variants do not disguise
frequencies — they rearrange them. This distinction matters. Frequency analysis
remains possible, but indirect.
</p>

<p>
My approach relies on identifying probable word fragments (cribs) and testing
positions. Success depends less on mathematics and more on language instinct.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">TEES TETN HIRP APT</div>

<div class="note">
Personal note: Transposition work is exhausting. It feels closer to puzzle
solving than analysis.
</div>

<h2>Vigenère and Polyalphabetic Systems</h2>

<p>
Vigenère represents a psychological turning point. It acknowledges that
repetition is dangerous and attempts to disguise it. For a time, this worked.
</p>

<p>
The weakness is not mathematical. It is human. Keys are reused. Keys are short.
Keys are meaningful. Kasiski examination and index of coincidence exploit this
predictability relentlessly.
</p>

<div class="cipher-text">LXFOPVEFRNHR</div>

<div class="note">
Revision (2018): Vigenère fails not because it is weak, but because people are.
</div>

<h2>On Method</h2>

<p>
Classical cryptanalysis rewards patience and familiarity with language. It does
not reward creativity. Once the tools are learned, outcomes become predictable.
This predictability is unsettling.
</p>

<p>
I find myself returning to these systems less frequently. Not because they lack
value, but because they lack surprise.
</p>

<div class="note">
Uncomfortable conclusion: If a cipher can be mastered completely, it no longer
holds my attention.
